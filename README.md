# pix2pix-runway-HansHofmann

A small side project exploring pix2pix, and runwayML. 
Trained a GAN using abstract expressionism art by Hans Hofmann.

Model is hosted at https://curly-excited-quicksand.glitch.me/. 

You can draw in the rectangle on the left side, and a Hans Hofmann-ish painting will be generated on the right side. Feel free to play with it.
